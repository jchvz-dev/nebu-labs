        <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Border is a real-time platform that allows users to monitor and update the status of lines at land border crossings between the United States and Mexico. The App provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time status updates for border crossing wait times</li>
            <li>The ability for users to contribute status updates and wait time information</li>
            <li>A personal log feature for manually registered border crossings (available in future releases)</li>
            <li>Estimated wait time calculations based on aggregated user data and location information</li>
            <li>Guest access (limited functionality without account creation)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Account Creation</h3>
        <p>You may use the App as a guest or create an account. To create an account, you must provide a valid email address and create a password, or authenticate through third-party services (Apple Sign-In, Facebook, Google, or other supported authentication methods).</p>

        <h3>4.2 Account Security</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Account Termination</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time for violation of these Terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion.</p>

        <h2>5. User Conduct and Contributions</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Status Updates</h3>
        <p>Users may submit real-time status updates regarding border crossing wait times and conditions. By submitting updates, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, display, and aggregate this information.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Data Accuracy</h3>
        <p>While we strive to provide accurate information, wait times and status updates are based on user contributions and automated estimations. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any information displayed in the App.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Prohibited Conduct</h3>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Submit false, misleading, or inaccurate information</li>
            <li>Use the App for any illegal purpose</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the App or its systems</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality</li>
            <li>Use automated systems to access or collect data from the App</li>
            <li>Harass, abuse, or harm other users</li>
            <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Location Data and Geofencing</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Location Collection</h3>
        <p>The App collects your device location when you manually share it by joining a line or updating status. We use geofencing technology to automatically detect when you are near a port of entry to track wait times.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Location Requirement</h3>
        <p>Opting out of location sharing will disable your ability to submit status updates and will limit you to viewing status information only.</p>

        <h3>6.3 Wait Time Tracking</h3>
        <p>When you join a line, the App may automatically track your wait time using location data and stop the timer when geofencing detects you have crossed the border. This data is used to improve wait time estimations for all users.</p>

        <h2>7. Advertising</h2>
        <p>The App displays advertisements through Google AdMob. By using the App, you agree to the display of such advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information about your device and usage patterns. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>

        <h2>8. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases</h2>

        <h3>8.1 Future Subscription Features</h3>
        <p>We may offer subscription-based premium features in the future. Any subscriptions will be subject to additional terms that will be presented to you at the time of purchase.</p>

        <h3>8.2 Payment Processing</h3>
        <p>Payments will be processed through third-party payment processors (such as RevenueCat and applicable app store payment systems). Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and conditions.</p>

        <h3>8.3 Billing and Cancellation</h3>
        <p>Subscription terms, including billing cycles, pricing, and cancellation policies, will be clearly disclosed at the time of purchase.</p>
